bug in table antd

description : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77103573/antd-table-scroll-virtualization-axis-y


 Case: I make a antd table, turned on the virtualization, set the values on the "X" and "y" axes in numbers.

Problem: If the table on the "y" axis (height) is larger than the content, then horizontal scrolling does not work. Please tell me how to solve this.

I need the virtual because my data can be very large and to avoid possible display problems, im use it
